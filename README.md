### Heyo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer student at [Codam Coding College](https://www.codam.nl/en/).
As part of my studies I did an internship at [Vandebron](https://vandebron.nl/).

My interests in programming were sparked by the game [Arma 3](https://arma3.com/). I have made some scripts and mod(s) for the game, and ultimately this set me on the path to becoming a software engineer.

I keep all personal projects and projects I completed at Codam here on github. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to create a new issue, pull request, or to reach out.
